This project is an **automated Twitter bot** built using **Python and Selenium**. It is designed to check your current internet speed and compare it against your promised internet speed by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). If the actual speed is lower than the promised speed, the bot automatically logs in to Twitter and tweets a complaint on your behalf.

- Automatically tests internet speed using [Speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/)
- Compares actual upload/download speeds with promised values
- Logs into Twitter using provided credentials
- Tweets a complaint message tagging the internet provider
